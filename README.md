Supinfo school project on a domotique house

## Context

In the context of the year 2018-2019 I chose to make a project that brought together 3D printing, cumputer science and electronics. The principle was to be able to have a complete project which includes several aspects of digital technology.
My project is to create a model of a Domotised House.

## The Project

1. A domotised house model printed with a 3D printer

2. Installation of LEDs, temperature sensor and LCD screen. All this controlled by microcontrollers.

3. Installation of a sliding garage door that can be opened with a contactless card

4. Setting up a web page for remote control of the house

## What I learned

* Print and modelise a 3D house
* Setup a Linux environnement with a web server
* How to use a Flask web server
* Setup a I2C bus
* Control sensors with arduinos and a web app
